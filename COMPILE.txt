OpenDCP
------------
This program builds the XML files for Digital Cinema Packages. 

Requirements
------------
The program requires the following libraries.
 
  - AS-DCP File Access Library (http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/)
  - OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/crypto.html)
  - LibXML2 (http://xmlsoft.org/)
  - LibXSLT (http://xmlsoft.org/)
  - LibXMLSec (http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/)
  - OpenJPEG (http://www.openjpeg.org)

Mac OS X and many linux distributions already have OpenSSL (libcrypto) installed.

Cmake
------------
CMake is used to build this application. You may need to install CMake.
Most linux distributions have CMake installed or have it available through the package manager.
On Mac OSX, CMake is easily installed with MacPorts.

Compile
------------
Type 'cmake .'
This will build the Makefiles for OpenDCP using dynamic libraries.

Type 'cmake -DSTATIC=1 .'
This will build the Makefiles for OpenDCP using static libraries. See notes about static compiling.

Type 'make'
This will compile the OpenDCP tools.

You should end up with opendcp_xml, opendcp_j2k in the build directory.

Install
------------
There is no need to install, but there is an install option which installs into /usr/local/bin

Type 'make install'

Static Notes
------------
Static libraries are included for OSX and WIN32. On Linux, you'll most likey want dynamically compile.

The static libraries included were compiled as follows:

AS-DCP
./configure --with-expat
make

OpenSSL
./configure
make

OpenJPEG
cmake .
make
