OpenDCP
------------
This program builds the XML files for Digital Cinema Packages. 

Requirements
------------
The program requires the following libraries. The versions listed are the ones tested with OpenDCP.
 
  - AS-DCP File Access Library 1.7.40 (http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/)
  - OpenSSL 0.9.8 (http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/crypto.html)
  - LibXML2 2.7.8 (http://xmlsoft.org/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibXSLT 1.1.26 (http://xmlsoft.org/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibXMLSec 1.2.16 (http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibTIFF 3.9.4 (http://www.libtiff.org/)
  - OpenJPEG 1.4 (http://www.openjpeg.org)

Mac OS X and many linux distributions already have OpenSSL (libcrypto) installed.

Cmake
------------
CMake is used to build this application. You may need to install CMake.
Most linux distributions have CMake installed or have it available through the package manager.
On Mac OSX, CMake is easily installed with MacPorts.

Compile
------------
It is recommended you perform an out-of-source build. This will prevent cluttering the source directory.
This can be performed from anywhere, just give cmake the path to the root directory of the OpenDCP source.

For example, if the OpenDCP source is in /home/opendcp, but you want to build in /home/opendcp-build

# cd /home/opendcp-build
# cmake /home/opendcp/

By default XMLSEC libraries are not enabled, to enabled add the ENABLE_XMLSEC flag

# cmake -DENABLE_XMLSEC=ON /home/opendcp

If you want to statically link OpenDCP (not recommended), you can add the ENABLE_STATIC flag

# cmake -DENABLE_STATIC=ON /home/opendcp

Once cmake completes, you should have the necessary make files. To compile issue the make command.

# make

You should end up with opendcp_xml, opendcp_xml, opendc_xml_verify (if XMLSEC enabled) opendcp_j2k in the bin directory of youe build tree.

Install
------------
You can install OpenDCP so you can invoke the command from anywhere.

# make install
